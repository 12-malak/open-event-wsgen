[{"session_type": null, "short_abstract": "<p>Investigative journalists should maintain a secure communication channel for exchanging information and documents with their sources. You may think that such channels are difficult and expensive to set up and operate, but the contrary is true: it is simple and cheap. If all you understand about security is that HTTPS is a good thing, there is something for you ... and it will be more secure than systems designed for receiving classified documents. Sounds like a paradox? Think about what happens when you are forced to use a password so complex no human being can remember it. It will end up being written on a sticker next to your keyboard, no longer providing any kind of security. After you learn more about security, 2FA, E2E, live systems, etc., familiarize yourself with practical solutions for applying these skills and activating stronger protection. Eventually, you will be able and equipped to protect the next Edward Snowden and save us all from George Orwell's worst nightmare.</p>", "speakers": [{"short_biography": "Lo\u00efc Dachary has been involved with the Free Software Movement since 1987, when he started distributing GNU tapes to the general public.
